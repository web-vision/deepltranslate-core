Version 3.x > 4.x
=================

If you are upgrading from 3.x on TYPO3 11 LTS to 12 LTS and you have used the site
config setup for translations, you can simply update.

Upgrade with Core Upgrade
-------------------------

If you are upgrading from a TYPO3 version below v11, you need to define the target
languages in the site configuration. See :ref:`sitesetup<Site Setup section>`
in this documentation.

Version 2.x > 3.x
=================

..  note:: This Upgrade is only needed, if you are using glossary functionality.

Run the Upgrade wizard shipped with version 3. The wizard only appears, if necessary:

..  figure:: /Images/Administration/upgrade-wizard-v3.png
    :alt: Screenshot ob backend Upgrade wizard

This wizard moves your glossaries to the new structure, fixes backend group
rights and changes the module name.

After this, you have to run a GlossarySync update, either by CLI or by backend

#.  :ref:`sync-cli`
#.  :ref:`glossaries`
